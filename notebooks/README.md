# Notebooks

A number of different directions that aren't necessarily substantial enough to form the main code of this project have been explored as jupyter notebooks. These notebooks are explained briefly below:

## compare.ipynb
Comparison between the independent, population count and pairwise implementations in this project to the matlab maxent_toolbox implementations. The respective models in each implementation are trained on the same data and the weights and predicted distributions are compared, though only for $N=10$.
