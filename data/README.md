## Data folder

The data for this project was downloaded from [research explorer](https://research-explorer.app.ist.ac.at/record/5562) and was collected as part of the 2014 paper *Searching for Collective Behavior in a Large Network of Sensory Neurons* by Tkaƒçik et al. 


The data folder is organised offline as follows:
- raw_data:

    [Offline]

    Contains raw data downloaded from research explorer.

- shuffled_data: 
    
    [Offline]

    Contains the two shuffled datasets processed in matlab as .csv and .mat files the full unshuffled dataset in numpy format.
- subsets: 
    
    [Offline]

    Defines the ID numbers for the different subsets

- pop:

    [Online]
    Saved matlab weights for the proof of principle (P.O.P) notebook

- trained_models:

    [Online]

    Save the models trained in matlab as .mat and also their weights as .csv

To do (if it's worth it): 
- expectations:

    [Online]

    extract expectations from different subsets so they can easily be read in for training python models
